"""
Spectral Power Of the Reionization Epoch (SPORE)
------------------------------------------------

A python package which aims to implement algorithm(s) for statistical detection of the 21cm power spectrum,
especially at the Epoch of Reionisation.

Initially, this will focus on the inverse-covariance weighting algorithm for the 2D power-spectrum, and
specifically the foreground covariance modelling in this context. It may never get further...
